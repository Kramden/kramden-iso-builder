The System Info screen will provide information necessary to fill out the tracking sheet as well as determine if the system meets the minimum system requirements as well as show the result of the check to ensure the system was installed properly.

Pay specific attention to the "System Check" section at the bottom.  The text should be green to indicate it passed.  If the text is red, the text provided should provide a clear indication of what failed.

After filling out the tracking sheet and confirming the tests passed, select "Landscape" from the navigation bar on the left
